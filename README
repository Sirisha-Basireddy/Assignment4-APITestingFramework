# API Testing with RestAssured and TestNG

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates API testing using **RestAssured** and **TestNG**. The tests are written to validate various endpoints provided by the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which serves as a public mock API for testing and prototyping.

The project includes:
- Testing different HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT.
- Validation of response status codes, response time, and response body structure.
- Tests for both successful and edge case scenarios.

## Features
- **GET Tests**: Validates retrieval of posts and ensures response structure is correct.
- **POST Tests**: Ensures new resources can be created and their data is accurately returned.
- **PUT Tests**: Tests updating existing resources.
- **Performance Tests**: Verifies that responses meet acceptable performance thresholds.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles scenarios like querying non-existent users.
